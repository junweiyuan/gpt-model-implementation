## Technical Highlights

### Mathematical Foundations

**Attention Mechanism**:
```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k)V
```

**Positional Encoding**:
```
PE(pos, 2i) = sin(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))
PE(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))
```

**Layer Normalization**:
```
LayerNorm(x) = γ * (x - μ) / √(σ² + ε) + β
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Causal Masking**: Ensures autoregressive property for language modeling
2. **Pre-LayerNorm**: Layer norm before attention/FFN (more stable training)
3. **GELU Activation**: Smooth activation function, better than ReLU for transformers
4. **Scaled Embeddings**: Token embeddings scaled by √d_model
5. **Residual Connections**: Enable deep network training
6. **Gradient Clipping**: Prevent exploding gradients

### Model Scalability

The implementation supports various model sizes:

| Configuration | Parameters | Layers | d_model | Heads | Context |
|--------------|------------|---------|---------|-------|---------|
| Tiny         | ~400K      | 2       | 128     | 4     | 64      |
| Small        | ~15M       | 6       | 256     | 8     | 256     |
| Medium       | ~60M       | 8       | 512     | 8     | 512     |
| Large        | ~117M      | 12      | 768     | 12    | 1024    |

## Testing & Validation

The implementation has been tested for:
- ✓ Forward pass correctness
- ✓ Backward pass and gradients
- ✓ Text generation
- ✓ Loss computation
- ✓ Tokenization/detokenization

## Generation Strategies

### 1. Temperature Sampling
Controls the randomness of predictions by scaling logits.

### 2. Top-k Sampling
Filters to only the k most likely tokens before sampling.

Samples from the smallest set of tokens with cumulative probability ≥ p.

All strategies are implemented and can be combined for optimal results.
